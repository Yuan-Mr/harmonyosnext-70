### Discover HarmonyOS Treasures: Battle Guide for Cross-Thread Serialization Performance Optimization  

Hello everyone! Today, while browsing HarmonyOS documentation, I unearthed a super practical tool‚ÄîDevEco Profiler's serialization detection function! When using TaskPool or Worker for multi-threaded development, I often encountered cross-thread object lag issues, only to find HarmonyOS already provides solutions. Below, combined with code and practical cases, I'll guide you through mastering performance optimization!  


### I. Pain Point: Why Does Cross-Thread Serialization Slow Performance?  
When objects are passed across threads (e.g., main thread ‚Üí child thread), the system automatically serializes and deserializes them. If the object structure is complex (e.g., nested arrays, class methods), time consumption surges! Take this example:  

```typescript
// Unoptimized approach: Pass entire object  
class Book {  
  title: string = "";  
  content: string = "";  
  authorList: string[] = []; // Array members may be large!  
}  

// Pass data from main thread to child thread  
taskpool.execute(processBooks, bookList); // Serialization triggered here!
```  
**Problem**: When `bookList` contains 50,000 books, serialization may take 260ms+! The main thread freezes directly!  


### II. Treasure Tool: DevEco Profiler Serialization Detection  
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Activation Steps  
1. Open DevEco Studio ‚Üí Profiler ‚Üí Select Frame template.  
2. Click Record ‚Üí Operate the app to trigger cross-thread communication.  
3. Stop recording ‚Üí View timeout warnings (red markers) in the Anomaly lane.  

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Locate Problem Code  
- Select the timeout area ‚Üí View the ArkTS Callstack lane ‚Üí Double-click the call stack to jump to the source code!  

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Customize Timeout Threshold  
Click Options in the Anomaly lane ‚Üí Set the threshold (default 8ms) for different performance requirements:  
```typescript
Profiler.enableSerializationTimeoutCheck(threshold: 5); // Change to 5ms for warnings
```  


### III. Optimization Plan: Sendable Transformation + Data Slimming  
HarmonyOS recommends using Sendable objects (reference passing) instead of serialization, boosting efficiency by N times!  

#### ‚úÖ Case 1: Book Data Transfer Optimization  
**Before transformation (260ms serialization)**:  
```typescript
class Book {  
  // Non-Sendable object, every field is copied  
  title: string = "";  
  authorList: string[] = [];  
}  

const bookList: Book[] = load50000Books(); // 50,000 books  
taskpool.execute(processBooks, bookList); // Stuck in main thread serialization!
```  

**After transformation (<8ms)**:  
```typescript
// Key: Implement the Sendable interface!  
class Book implements Sendable {  
  // 1. Retain only primitive type fields  
  title: string = "";  
  // 2. Avoid complex structures, replace arrays with reference IDs  
  authorIds: number[] = [];  

  // 3. Query data on demand in child threads  
  static async getAuthors(ids: number[]): Promise<string[]> {  
    return db.queryAuthors(ids); // Database query in child thread  
  }  
}  

// Main thread passes only necessary data  
taskpool.execute(processBooks, bookList.map(b => b.authorIds));
```  

#### ‚úÖ Case 2: Image Processing Scenario Optimization  
**Anti-pattern**: Directly pass image data  
```typescript
// Main thread reads image ‚Üí serializes and passes ‚Üí child thread processes  
const imageData: ArrayBuffer = readFile("large_image.jpg");  
taskpool.execute(processImage, imageData); // May timeout!
```  

**Optimization**: Pass file path + offset  
```typescript
// Main thread  
const imageInfo = { path: "large_image.jpg", offset: 0 };  
taskpool.execute(processImage, imageInfo); // Completes instantly!  

// Child thread  
@Concurrent  
function processImage(info: { path: string, offset: number }) {  
  const buffer = readFileSegment(info); // Child thread reads file itself  
}
```  


### IV. Performance Comparison: Immediate Results  

| Solution                | 50,000 Books Serialization Time | Main Thread Lag |  
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|  
| Unoptimized (normal object) | 260ms+                         | Obvious lag     |  
| Sendable transformation   | <8ms                           | Unnoticeable    |  
| File path instead of data  | <1ms                           | Unnoticeable    |  


### V. Pitfall Prevention Summary  
1. **Use Sendable where possible**: Implement the Sendable interface for classes and avoid complex structures internally.  
2. **Data slimming**: Pass the smallest dataset (e.g., IDs, paths) and query on demand in child threads.  
3. **Regular tool usage**: Enable Profiler recording during development to periodically detect serialization time.  
4. **Beware of large objects**: Exercise caution when passing objects over 10KB!
